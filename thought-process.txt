Thought process
Stack:
1. Terraform: Apart from tutorials, I haven't used it before in any deployments. I believe its the most intuitive and robust IaC tool. 
I was able to transfer knowledge and concept from similar tools like ARM templates to bring up a standard infrastructure.
I understand the environment provisioned might not be 'bare metal' but I'd like to call it my version 1.

2. AWS: My preferred cloud platform because of their impeccable documentations and extensive-ness. 
I just assumed it will be clear to create the deployment on AWS plus I have used the Boto3 SDK previously for a somewhat similar deployment.

HA:
The kubernetes worker nodes are configured to be deployed in multiple subnets and available zones to ensure high availability.
Pods as well will be deployed evenly to these nodes in various subnets.

Security:
kubernetes cluster is deployed in private subnets with the necessary security groups rules.
Self-signed certificate was created using OpenSSL and uploaded to IAM via CLI

I enjoyed the exercise!
